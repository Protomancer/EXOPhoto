        EXOPhoto is a project that has begun, in a way, to learn and grow my skills in web design. EXOPhoto is under construction. If your interested in photography, art, design and how we can incorporate those interests in the preservation of the environment, please follow along and perhaps join up to help keep our homes and nature beautiful.
